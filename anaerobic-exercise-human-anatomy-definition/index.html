The Role Of Carbohydrate, Fat And Protein As Fuels For Aerobic And From uyunsahito1.blogspot.com
Anaerobic exercises cause an oxygen debt, which is a lack of oxygen in the muscles of the body. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time.

Anaerobic literally means âwithout air,â so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. Sprint interval training, or sit, is a form of high intensity interval training (hiit) that involves running as fast as you can. Infections like tetanus and gangrene are caused by anaerobic bacteria.
