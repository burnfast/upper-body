Anaerobic exercises cause an oxygen debt, which is a lack of oxygen in the muscles of the body. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time.

Anaerobic literally means “without air,” so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. Sprint interval training, or sit, is a form of high intensity interval training (hiit) that involves running as fast as you can. Infections like tetanus and gangrene are caused by anaerobic bacteria.
