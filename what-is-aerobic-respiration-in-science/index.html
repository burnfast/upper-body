Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. C 6 h 12 o 6 &#43; 6o 2 → 6co 2 &#43; 6h 2 o &#43; energy the chemical energy released is. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food.

If oxygen is present, the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is oxidized further in the krebs cycle, a continuation of aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is a more efficient process than anaerobic respiration because it produces more atp per molecule of glucose than anaerobic respiration.

<p>Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. This stage doesn’t require oxygen so it is an anaerobic process and is involved in both aerobic and anaerobic respiration pathways. Scientific modeling has been indispensable for understanding cellular respiration. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water.

<p>Aerobic respiration is a more efficient process than anaerobic respiration because it produces more atp per molecule of glucose than anaerobic respiration. Aerobic, or respiration in the presence of oxygen, and anaerobic, or respiration without oxygen. It is a process when glucose is broken down in the absence of oxygen. It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp.
