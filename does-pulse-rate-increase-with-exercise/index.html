In other words, when you perform an exercise, certain body parts start working faster, demanding more oxygen and blood. This is why when we exercise both pulse/heart rate and breathing rate increase. This includes greater ability to utilize oxygen, better blood flow in small arteries around your heart and an improved cholesterol profile. To meet that demand, your heart has to beat faster.

<p>Why does heart rate increase when exercising. Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. When you exercise and your muscles work harder, your body uses more oxygen and produces more carbon dioxide. When you are exercising, the heartâs blood flow increases by around four or five times from when you are at rest.</p>

<p>Because of the increased activity, your muscles need more oxygen. If you measure your heart rate (take your pulse) before, during and after physical activity, youâll notice it will increase over the course.

<p>But if you're doing aerobics or cardiovascular exercise (like running, bicycling, or rowing) you are still using one muscle in particular &amp;md your heart is a muscle. Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. When you exercise, including running, your heart rate will increase, meaning that your pulse will become faster because your body is under physical stress. When under stress, your heart must pump more blood containing oxygen and nutrients throughout your body, which is why your pulse increases. A Healthy Human Heart.</p>
