Your heart is a muscle just like any. According to a study, researchers found that overweight participants who engaged in cardiovascular endurance exercises burned 400 to 600 calories, 5 times a week for almost 10 months. The capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to provide oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy synthesis during physical activity is referred to as cardiorespiratory fitness (crf). Metabolic equivalents (mets) are used to measure your intensity of exercise and uptake of oxygen.
