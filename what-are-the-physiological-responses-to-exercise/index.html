Which internal body temperature is regulated by the control of the thermoregulatory effector responses of skin blood flow and sweating. Within the context of human adaptation and performance, it will explore the central role that biomedical science is playing in directing. To meet the needs of working muscle, the body has an orchestrated response involving the heart, blood vessels, nervous system, lungs, liver and skin. The respiratory system • the lungs, mouth, throat and nose make up the respiratory system • one of the major functions of the respiratory system is to bring oxygen into the body and remove carbon dioxide.

<p>To meet the needs of working muscle, the body has an orchestrated response involving the heart, blood vessels, nervous system, lungs, liver and skin. All of these benefits are closely related to the physiological effects of exercise. Exercise challenges many human physiological systems that need to adapt in order to maintain homeostasis, this is the inner balance of the body. Body systems work together, to make sure that you have enough energy to perform.</p>

<p>To meet the needs of working muscle, the body has an orchestrated response involving the heart, blood vessels, nervous system, lungs, liver and skin. The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a massive increase in cardiac output combined with a massive decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, predominantly of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. Studies in humans and animals have shown that brain blood flow remains largely unchanged in response to acute. The more strenuous the exercise, the greater the demands of working muscle.
