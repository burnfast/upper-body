Anaerobic training specifically develops the two anaerobic energy systems and often develops power, strength and speed in the process.

<p>Because interval training is intense, it is a great method for improving both aerobic and anaerobic fitness. Anaerobic training enhances the anaerobic metabolic capacity of the muscle fibres that are being trained, thus increasing the ability of the athlete to train, and therefore perform at higher exercise intensity (mcardle et.
