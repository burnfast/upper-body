Bodybuilding.com&#39;s calorie burn calculator is based on the 2011 compendium of physical activities, an authoritative list of the calories burned by 821 different activities including not only exercise, but daily activities like housecleaning—even sleeping. Whether you’re trying to get lean, maintain your weight or bulk up, you need to know how many calories you’re consuming and burning. Adjusting the activity level to lightly active would allow for 1,639 calories per day on a 500 calorie per day deficit and remain at 1,200 calories per day for a 1,000 calorie deficit. Calories = 7 * 60 * 8 * 3.5 * 90 / 200 = 6284 kcal.
