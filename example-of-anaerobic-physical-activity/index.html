<p>Soccer soccer is a good example of anaerobic activity that couples bursts of maximum effort with less effort and then back to maximum effort. During the lifting of weights the muscles operate at maximum capacity, fulfilling the designated task during a short interval of time, because one is not going to the breathing to renew the energies. As an example here, we can take the 400m sprint. Aerobic exercises like jogging, running, dancing and stepping exercises are designed to strengthen the cardiovascular and respiratory functions of the body.

Anaerobic respiration is a kind of respiration process which doesnât require o2 molecule as electron acceptor or simply we can say that anaerobic respiration occurs in absence of oxygen. Fast twitch muscles (as compared to slow twitch muscles) operate using anaerobic metabolic systems, such that any use of fast twitch muscle fibers leads to an increased anaerobic energy expenditure. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time.
