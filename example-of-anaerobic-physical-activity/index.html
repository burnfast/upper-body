During the lifting of weights the muscles operate at maximum capacity, fulfilling the designated task during a short interval of time, because one is not going to the breathing to renew the energies. As an example here, we can take the 400m sprint. Aerobic exercises like jogging, running, dancing and stepping exercises are designed to strengthen the cardiovascular and respiratory functions of the body.
