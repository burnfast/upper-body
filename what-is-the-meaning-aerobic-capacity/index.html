Aerobic Capacity lesson 1 From slideshare.net
Aerobic capacity is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use at one time. It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. The individual’s aerobic capacity defines the size of the engine in a human being, much as in an automobile. | meaning, pronunciation, translations and examples
