<p>Anaerobic treatment is used before aerobic treatment so the high concentration of organic material is removed effectively. Anaerobic digestion process in wastewater treatment is regarded as one of the most potent ways to deal with wastewater and its management. The egsb system offers big practical potential for wastewater treatment, for example, for very low strength wastewaters (cod âª 1 g/l), and at temperatures as low as 10Â° c. As the bacteria work on the wastewater, biogas is generated which can be used to generate electricity in some situations.</p>
