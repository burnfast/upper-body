The respiration rate is a parameter which is used in ecological and agronomical modeling.in theoretical production ecology and aquaculture, it typically refers to respiration per unit of time (usually loss of biomass by respiration per unit of weight), also referred to as relative respiration rate.in theoretical production ecology, biomass is expressed as dry weight, in aquaculture as.

Respiratory rate is a vital sign but it is frequently omitted, inaccurately measured and not recorded. The inhalation and exhalation are known as the respiratory cycle. Infant (1 to 12 months): In adults, an elevated respiratory rate is generally considered to be more than 20 rpm.

<p>A range of 12 to 28 breaths per minute is normal for adults between 65 and 80 years. Respiration rates may increase with fever, illness, or other medical conditions. And for adults over 80, the normal respiration range is about 10 to 30 breaths per minute. Rapid shallow breathing is referred to as tachypnea, which means you take more breaths than usual in one minute.</p>
