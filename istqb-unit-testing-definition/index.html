Mule ESB Testing (Part 1/3) Unit and functional testing Conrad Pöpke From cpoepke.wordpress.com
This syllabus (henceforth called tta syllabus) contains a chapter dedicated to condition testing (apparently this is also called condition coverage or condition coverage testing.). One to verify the change has not broken the existing, working code and the second to ensure the defect has been fixed. Understand the business objectives, communicate with business units, and share common objectives for acceptance testing. System testing also aims to find defects and to prevent defects from escaping to higher test levels or production.

A unit test, as agile teams understand the term, is a short program fragment written and maintained by the developers on the product team, which exercises some narrow part of the product’s source code and checks the results. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence testing can show that defects. Conceptually design, implement, and execute basic performance tests.
