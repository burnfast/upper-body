The Most Effective Crossfit Cardio Workouts At Home Or Not K Squared From ksquaredfitness.com
Since pushing is not everything that our upper body is capable of, we also need an exercise for pulling movements. Programming pull ups, pull ups and muscle ups in a single workout with no balance from any of the other muscles is, in my opinion, plain bad. Bodyweight exercises are simple, effective and a foundational part of crossfit. Crossfit is one of the most effective ways to get fit, burn fat, and get stronger.
