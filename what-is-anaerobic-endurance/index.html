Often, aerobic endurance and muscular endurance are used interchangeably, but they are actually two different. Immediate anaerobic energy system, and; Aerobic to anaerobic transition intensity is one of the most significant physiological variable in endurance sports. Anaerobic endurance training focuses on the physiological improvements in the muscles’ ability to endure force output through both neural and metabolic mechanisms.
