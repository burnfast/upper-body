Strengthening of abdominal muscle is necessary for daily activities. Sports can burn more fat, calories and carbs without giving you the stress that are commonly associated with weight lifting and exercise. Lift one leg three to six inches off the ground with the foot flexed and hold for a few seconds, keeping the hips parallel to the floor. Indirectly, swimming will help you develop your abdominal muscles because it burns a lot of calories.
