Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute (bpm) while your body is in a state of rest — typically when you are sleeping or lying in bed after waking up. The average resting heart rate is usually between 60 and 80 bpm. For adults, a ‘normal’ rhr ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, although most people who are relaxed and healthy should be below 90. Typically individuals with higher vo2 max have lower heart rates while running at the same pace than individuals with lower vo2 max.
