Conversely, arterial stiffness appears to increase in both the elastic central arteries (14.5%) and the peripheral muscular arteries (8.7%) after resistance training. The lungs respond by “recruiting” an increased number of smaller vessels (or arterioles) in order to accommodate this increase in blood flow and maintain a stable pulmonary arterial pressure and a stable if not decreased pulmonary vascular resistance.
