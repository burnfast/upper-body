25 HIIT Cardio Workouts That Will Get You In The Best Shape Of Your From trimmedandtoned.com
Granted, i’m a strong believer in weight training in addition to cardio, so i encourage you to incorporate other workout routines/activities into your workout schedule. But i wanted to share some of the workouts i’ve created over the years that have a lot of cardio exercises (e.g., jumping jacks, jump squats, high knees, etc.) worked in. If you are also following a weight training program, complete 2 to 4 cardio workouts per week depending on your schedule, goals, and preferences. If you’re looking for an arm workout, try cross punches.
