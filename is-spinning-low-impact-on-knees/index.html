Keep in mind that knee pain is usually due to your kneecap going out of alignment, which then causes the surrounding muscles and ligaments to weaken and stiff. Opting for low impact exercise can be a good alternative after an injury or illness. Working with your healthcare provider and a physical therapist can help determine if that. The result of years of knee hyperextension is a subtle compression that can extend from the lower (lumbar) spine to the upper back and cervical spine (neck).
