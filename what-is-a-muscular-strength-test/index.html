<p>Muscle testing is an alternative medicine practice that claims to effectively diagnose structural, muscular, chemical, and psychological conditions through testing the strength of your muscles. Muscular strength is an aspect of physical fitness that is typically gauged with the maximum amount of weight that a given muscle can move for one repetition. Increased muscle strength can only be achieved by working. This method involves testing key muscles from the upper and lower extremities against the examiner’s resistance and grading the patient’s strength on a 0 to 5 scale accordingly[1]: 5 Ways to Test for Muscle Imbalances.</p>
