In humans, these bacteria generally live in the gastrointestinal tract, but they may also be found in other places outside the body, including in the soil and water, in foods, and in animals. Some anaerobes are tolerant to small amounts of oxygen. An anaerobic organism or anaerobe is any organism that does not require molecular oxygen for growth. Anaerobes grow in the depth of the medium, and the number of colonies becomes fewer towards.
