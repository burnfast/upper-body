A stress test usually involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while your heart rhythm, blood pressure and breathing are monitored. If you aren’t able to exercise, you’ll receive a drug through an iv that mimics exercise by increasing blood flow to your heart. During this period, it becomes possible to check the heart rhythm, breathing, and blood pressure. So, the exercise/stress test usually takes an hour, including the prep time and the actual testing time.
