Cellular Respiration From slideshare.net
Cellular respiration definition, the oxidation of organic compounds that occurs within cells, producing energy for cellular processes. Glycolysis takes place in the cytosol, the citric acid cycle. Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that break down glucose to produce atp, which may be used as energy to power many reactions throughout the body. Oxidation of pyruvate is the second step of aerobic respiration occurring, representing one.

<p>Cellular respiration sustains aerobic life and involves the oxidation of nutrients, with the final production of carbon dioxide and water. Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic reactions that occur within the cells of organisms (both plants and animals) to convert biochemical energy derived from nutrients to adenosine triphosphate (atp) and then release waste products. Cellular respiration refers to the metabolic reactions at the cellular level that result in the breakdown of molecules from nutrients and the release of energy that is used to fuel cellular processes. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions occurring inside the cells to convert biochemical energy obtained from the food into a chemical compound called adenosine triphosphate (atp).
