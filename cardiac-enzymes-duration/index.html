The markers are normally present at all times, however, they are significantly elevated during a damage of the heart muscle. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle.creatine kinase and troponin are the two proteins currently measured in biomarker tests.

<p>Duration of cpr correlates with elevation of troponin i, a marker of cardiac injury, providing an association between cc and cardiac ischemia [54]. Troponin i and troponin t. Peaks tend to occur earlier and are often higher, following successful thrombolytic therapy. Elevated heart enzyme levels can also indicate acute coronary syndrome or ischemia.
