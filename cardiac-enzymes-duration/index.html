The markers are normally present at all times, however, they are significantly elevated during a damage of the heart muscle. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle.creatine kinase and troponin are the two proteins currently measured in biomarker tests.

<p>Healthcare providers use enzyme marker tests (blood tests) to measure. The markers are normally present at all times, however, they are significantly elevated during a damage of the heart muscle. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle.creatine kinase and troponin are the two proteins currently measured in biomarker tests.
