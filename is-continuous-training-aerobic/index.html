To cool down after a brisk walk, walk slowly for five to 10 minutes. To cool down after swimming, swim laps leisurely for five to 10. However, it is important to keep in mind that aerobic metabolism is. Aerobic development is achieved by elevating the heart rate and maintaining this level for an extended time.

<p>Aerobic development is achieved by elevating the heart rate and maintaining this level for an extended time. The primary outcome was change in peak oxygen uptake. Continuous training is a form of exercise that is performed at a 'continuous' intensity throughout and doesn’t involve any rest periods. Continuous aerobic training is defined as exercise (e.g., running, cycling, swimming, etc.) lasting greater than 20 minutes and held at steady intensity during the entire bout.</p>

<p>Aerobic exercises such as running, biking, swimming, and rowing are common in continuous training. Continuous ‘steady state’ exercise is performed aerobically. Aerobic endurance training programs in particular require thought and creativity, due to the broad range of activities that fall under the umbrella of aerobic endurance. Maximal aerobic capacity — a marker of fitness level — increased by 4.5% for continuous exercisers and by 8.7% in the intermittent group. BTec Sport Blog September 2010.</p>
