Cardiorespiratory fitness cardiorespiratory fitness is a measurement of a person’s ability to work with large muscle groups for longer periods of time. People of all ages need to be physically active for at least 30 minutes a day to maintain good health, but cardiorespiratory fitness is necessary for older adults.
