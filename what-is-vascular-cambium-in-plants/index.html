Vascular cambium and cork cambium secondary growth in plants. Woody plants also have secondary indeterminate mitotic regions towards the exterior of roots, stems and branches that produce the cells for continued growth in girth. Vascular cambium produces vascular tissue to help the conduction inside the plant and provides structural support to the plant. A new pair of papers investigates how the arabidopsis root vascular cambium forms and how it functions.

<p>The vascular cambium are meristematic tissues involved in the lateral growth and their continued production of the new phloem and xylem, the shoot vascular cambium in woody plants constitute the wood. It is to note that vascular cambium is absent from most monocotyledons, pteridophytes and some herbaceous dicotyledons. The vascular cambium functions throughout the life of woody perennials. In secondary origin, the cambium is called interfascicular cambium.</p>
