List 3 differences between aerobic and anaerobic exercise From brainly.com
Aerobic and anaerobic process are the two types of cellular respiration methods used in different types of organisms. Once you understand your zones, then determining the difference between an aerobic and anaerobic effort while swimming, cycling. The difference in the level of organisms. In an adequate oxygen condition, the cells consume the sugar needed and the oxygen can fully oxidise the sugar.

<p>The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is that aerobic respiration uses oxygen in the glucose breakdown process, while anaerobic respiration does not. Energy for sit is produced via both the aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways and is potentially an effective means of increasing endurance performance. A process called cellular metabolism is conducted by the biological cell. Cardiovascular endurance improves in aerobic exercise, while anaerobic exercise focuses on the muscle ability.</p>

<p>There is also a difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Normally, organisms use oxygen to make energy, but these organisms have found ways to get around this.

<p>Another key difference is the fact that higher organisms have aerobic respiration whereas in lower organisms anaerobic respiration occurs.

<p>By now, you probably get the idea of how aerobic running differs from anaerobic running: Cardiovascular endurance improves in aerobic exercise, while anaerobic exercise focuses on the muscle ability. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, but it can still provide cells with the energy they need to function. Aerobic and anaerobic activities are also beneficial to one’s fitness. Aerobic and Anaerobic Training.</p>

<p>Aerobic means involving oxygen, so anaerobic bacteria can survive without oxygen. An aerobic process refers to a process that requires the presence of oxygen or air as opposed to an anaerobic process that does not require it. In an adequate oxygen condition, the cells consume the sugar needed and the oxygen can fully oxidise the sugar. Aerobic activity uses oxygen to burn carbohydrates and fat for energy while anaerobic activity only burns carbohydrates to produce energy.

The difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise is an important one to know because they differ in how your body produces energy during exercise, anaerobic exercise—like hiit—has been shown to burn more total calories in a shorter amount of time, exercise has also been shown to prevent osteoporosis, unlike aerobic exercise, anaerobic. When a cell needs to release energy, the cytoplasm (a substance between a cell's nucleus and its membrane) and mitochondria (organelles in cytoplasm that help with metabolic processes) initiate chemical exchanges that launch the breakdown of glucose.

They cannot tolerate oxygen at all and will die if exposed to an environment that has a high quantity of oxygen. Aerobic activity uses oxygen to burn carbohydrates and fat for energy while anaerobic activity only burns carbohydrates to produce energy. In an adequate oxygen condition, the cells consume the sugar needed and the oxygen can fully oxidise the sugar.</p>
