Aerobic Respiration Definition, Equation Steps, Examples, Formula From embibe.com
Glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Respiration is the process in which organisms exchange gases between their body cells and the environment. These catabolic reactions result in the release of adenosine triphosphate (atp) and waste products. It is the biochemical pathway to release energy.
