Perfusion technology is the study of physiology and the pathology of the lungs and the allied respiratory organs of the human body. However, there’s a difference between the two: Cardiac care technology measures how well a heart is functioning and can monitor heart rate bsc cardiology is three years undergraduate course. Bsc in cardio pulmonary perfusion technology is the study of physiology and the pathology of the lungs and the allied respiratory organs of the human body.
