How to Lower Your Resting Heart Rate. Specific Methods ⋆ From supastrong.net
Generally, a lower resting heart rate indicates a higher level of cardiovascular fitness. To find the target heart rate range for your age, subtract your age from 220 and then multiply that number by 0.60 and by 0.80 to find the low and high ends of the range. But if, for example, a woman has a resting heart rate of 50, that can mean either that she is very fit or that she naturally has a low resting heart rate. With top athletes, resting heart rate can be as low as 40 beats per minute.
