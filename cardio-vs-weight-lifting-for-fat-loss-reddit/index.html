Weight Lifting Vs Cardio For Fat Loss Reddit LOSWIE From loswie.blogspot.com
The 10 pounds was mostly fat in my belly not muscle. If you gained 10kg of muscle at the same time you lost 10kg of fat, you would be smaller. While you are more likely to burn lots more calories during a cardio session, there’s a good chance your metabolism will stay elevated for longer after a workout with weights. What sort of extra calories are you burning, should i just stick to an hour cardio and burn 750ish calories, or 30 mins cardio and burn half that, and then weights.
