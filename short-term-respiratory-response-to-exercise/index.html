<p>And so you can lose some fluid and heat from the respiratory system. During exercise, the gas exchange requirements of the lung increase due to an increased oxygen consumption and increased carbon dioxide production. Myoglobin releases its stored oxygen to use in aerobic respiration. This is due to the muscles demanding more oxygen and an increase in carbon dioxide levels stimulates faster and deeper breathing.
