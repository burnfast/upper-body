Airways are the pipes that carry air into the lungs, explains nhlbi. The respiratory system provides oxygen to be transported through the blood to the exercising muscles as well as eliminating carbon dioxide. And so you can lose some fluid and heat from the respiratory system. 23 stayed sedentary (sed group).

The current diagnostic procedures for assessing physiological response to exercise comprise blood lactates measurements, ergospirometry, and electrocardiography. This increases the rate of gas exchange and minute volume. In addition, the respiratory system helps buffer the metabolic acids as they build up during intense exercise.

<p>And so you can lose some fluid and heat from the respiratory system. During exercise, the gas exchange requirements of the lung increase due to an increased oxygen consumption and increased carbon dioxide production. Myoglobin releases its stored oxygen to use in aerobic respiration. This is due to the muscles demanding more oxygen and an increase in carbon dioxide levels stimulates faster and deeper breathing.
