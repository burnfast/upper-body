<p>As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit. When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that arenât working much (like your digestive tract or arms). Heart rate and exercise intensity share a direct, linear relationship: PPT Heart Rate PowerPoint Presentation, free download ID6661621.</p>
