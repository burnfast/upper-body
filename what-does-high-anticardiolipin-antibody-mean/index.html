<p>The antiphospholipid antibodies are the common antibodies for cardiolipin. Slightly or moderately positive results are sometimes temporarily. If the anticardiolipin antibodies test result in negative, then it means that the antibodies are not available or not available in the detectable level in the blood during the time when the test is performed. Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies that persist when tested again 12 weeks later indicate the likely continued presence of that specific antibody, which may be associated with an increased risk of excessive clotting or recurrent miscarriages.</p>

<p>The igm antibody recognizes a large variety of pathogenic antigens and plays an important role in body immunity.
