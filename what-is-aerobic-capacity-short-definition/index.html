Aerobic Capacity lesson 2 From slideshare.net
Aerobic capacity is commonly described by the o 2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake. Allow short but intense exercises. It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. The anaerobic capacity is the amount of energy that is obtained from anaerobic energy systems.

<p>If an individual performs regular exercise, his residual air capacity increases in comparison to an individual who does not perform regular exercise. Aerobic capacity, also known as cardiopulmonary capacity, cardiorespiratory fitness, or vo2 max, is a measurement of your maximum oxygen consumption during physical activity. While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity.
